# Price_Scraper-Selenium
In this code, I connect to a natural stone and jewelry website via Selenium, and perform a search based on a request received from a user. 
The results, including the category, name, and price of the items, are compiled into a list. 
I then store this data in a database and also save it as a CSV file.
